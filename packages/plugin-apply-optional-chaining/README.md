> The **optional chaining operator** (`?.`) enables you to read the value of a property located deep within a chain of connected objects without having to check that each reference in the chain is valid.
>
> The `?.` operator is like the `.` chaining operator, except that instead of causing an error if a reference is nullish (`null` or `undefined`), the expression short-circuits with a return value of `undefined`. When used with function calls, it returns `undefined` if the given function does not exist.
>
> This results in shorter and simpler expressions when accessing chained properties when the possibility exists that a reference may be missing. It can also be helpful while exploring the content of an object when there's no known guarantee as to which properties are required.
