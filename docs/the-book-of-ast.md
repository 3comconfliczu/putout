# The book of AST

Once upon a time 🐊**Putout** swim
over the river of Code and suddenly...

## MemberExpression

...he was interrupted by writings on the water:

```js
Friends['🐘']; // has computed value '🐘'
Friends.elephant; // has not computed value 'elephant'
```

"Anytime you access a **property** in **Object** or **index** of an **Array** you using **MemberExpression**, thought the crocodile wagging his tail.

## Expressions and Statements

"**Expressions** and **Statements** it's like an apples 🍎 and a tree 🌳", 🐊**Putout** said to his
friend 🦏 Rhino, when they meat early in the morning near river of Code.

```js
if (fruit === '🍎') // 🌳(🍎)
    eat('🍎'); // 🦏 ❤️ 🍎
```

"An apple can grow on a branch, but branch canno grow on apple, the same goes to **Expressions** and **Statements**", continued 🐊**Putout**.

"I like red apples", Rhino answered.
