Wrapper that simplifies [**ESLint**](https://eslint.org/) API and makes it compatible with 🐊[**Putout**](https://github.com/coderaiser/putout).

## Install

```
npm i @putout/eslint
```

## API

**ESLint** begins his work as a formatter when 🐊**Putout** done his transformations. That's why it used a lot in different parts of application, for testing purpose and using **API** in a simplest possible way. You can access it with:

```js
import eslint from '@putout/eslint';
```

To use it simply write:

```js
const [source, places] = await eslint({
    name: 'hello.js',
    code: `const t = 'hi'\n`,
    fix: false,
});
```

Isn't it looks similar to 🐊**Putout** way? It definitely is! But... It has a couple differences you should remember:

- ☝️ *[🐊**Putout** returns object with `code` and `places` properties](https://github.com/coderaiser/putout#plugins).*
- ☝️ ***ESLint** has a `name` property that is used to calculate configuration file.*

And you can even override any of **ESLint** ⚙️ options with help of `config` property:

```js
const [source, places] = await eslint({
    name: 'hello.js',
    code: `const t = 'hi'\n`,
    fix: false,
    config: {
        extends: [
            'plugin:putout/recommended',
        ],
    },
});
```

If you want to apply 🐊**Putout** transformations using [`putout/putout`](https://github.com/coderaiser/putout/tree/master/packages/eslint-plugin-putout#readme) **ESLint** rule, enable 🐊**Putout** with the same called flag lowercased:

```js
const [source, places] = await eslint({
    name: 'hello.js',
    code: `const t = 'hi'\n`,
    fix: true,
    putout: true,
    config: {
        extends: [
            'plugin:putout/recommended',
        ],
    },
});
```

It is disabled by default, because **ESLint** always runs after 🐊**Putout** transformations, so there is no need to traverse tree again.
